    "# CSC421 Assignment 1 Search, and CSP \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment notebook explores topics covered in **Chapter 3 - Searching** and **Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems** from the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.* The code provided is based on parts of the aima-code repository but has been adapted, modified and simplified for the purposes of the assignment. The notebook is self-contained and other than importing a few common packages you don't need to access any additional code. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome (and it can be educational) to look at the code at the aima-code repository and other code resources you can find on the web or ask ChatGPT. However, make sure you understand any code that you incorporate and submit. Plagiarism checking will be done. Additionally, at the teaching team's discretion, a random subset of students may be examined in person and asked questions about the code submitted. Failure to understand the submitted code will result in a 0 grade for the entire assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment structure is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search (Basic) -  Add a connection to the Romania map, try out search, print paths\n",
    "2. Search (Basic) -  Return frontier lengths\n",
    "3. Search (Expected) - RandomSearch  \n",
    "4. Search (Expected) - Change the grid problem to 4 directions and modulo movement \n",
    "5. Search (Expected) - Landgrid problem and manhattan distance\n",
    "6. CSP (Basic): Basic CSP for a map of Australia with unitary constraint  \n",
    "7. CSP (Advanced): Type inference toy example as CSP  \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** An assignment through Brightspace will provide the complete submission details. You will be required to submit this notebook. For working on the assignment, I recommend using the Jupyter-lab interface as it supports interactive development and is helpful for visualizations and plots. Please make sure the notebook you submit is clean, it should not be so heavily modified with debugging, figures, etc. that it becomes difficult to mark. Make sure that the notebook you submit is functioning and that you have used best practices in ensuring that (reloading the notebook, clearing history/memory, HINT: you may need to force refresh your browser (e.g., crtl+F5), ensuring that the submission is actually what you intend to submit for marking). We will **NOT** accept changes after the deadline if you have made a submission mistake."

    "1. Create a new class of search problems called **LandGridProblem** by copying and renaming the **GridProblemMod** class you completed in the previous question.\n",

This is similar to tile-based board games such as Settlers of Catan or computer games such as Civilization.\n",
    "3. You will need to modify the action_cost method to take into account the land cost. So if a path contains two grass squares, three hills, and one mountain the total path cost will be $2 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 10$.\n",
    "4. Add a **Manhattan distance** heuristic to your implementation. The **Manhattan distance** between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is defined as $|x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|$.
